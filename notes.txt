the init and the self

init method(function) is used to initiate objects
__init__ method is called every time a new object is created
init hold all the variables(attributes) used oop(by all the methods) simple.


self used to

# to append to a line A is used
# to reach the end of a line use $
# to switch panes in vs code use ctrl+1, ctrl+2, ctrl+2

there are two types of variables in oops
1.class variables (explictly defined in class)
2.instance variables(self.var)

to use variables from other class we use inheritance
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
24Jul22 7:54pm

we can either use:
a=class()
b=class()
a.method()
b.method()


or 




__init__ gets called once for every object 
initialization

self is used to access the values
self.attribute1
self.attribute2

object is created in heap memory



constructor, self

different  object has a different memory allocation
each time you run the code, object gets assigned a new address





size of object:
depends on number of variables and size of each variables

constructor allocates the size of variables

self contains default values of variables 

self directs the pointer to the object itself 

The Default __init__ Constructor in C++ and Java. 
Constructors are used to initializing the object’s state. 
The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values)
to the data members of the class when an object of the 
class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains 
a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed 
at the time of Object creation. 
It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. 
The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do
with your object.

u for undo
ctrl+r for redo

a=10
a is refrence variable, stored in stack
10 is the objeect, stored in heap
variables in stack memory pointing to the object in heap memory
more than one refrence variable point to the same object

if any of the reference variables change the object 
the value is being changed for all the variable 

object with no refrence variable, gets removed from the memory
when garbage collection hits.
(garbage collection hits automatically) thats how python works 
______________________________________________________________________________

java doesnt converts the code into machine code
instead it converts to byte code
byte code has extension .class

static variable is independent of the obkect of classes


how the java program gets executed:
(heirarcial order of the packages nested)
1.jdk: java development kit
       jdk = jre + dev_tools
       jdk is top level package
       it contains:
                a. development tools 
                b. jre
                c. jvac: a compiler
                d. jar: archiver, which packages all the code 
                e. javadoc: docs generator
                f. interprerter/loader

4.jre: java runtime enviorment
       jre = jvm + library_classes
3.jvm: java virtual machine

instance == obj

An instance is a specific representation of an object. 
An object is a generic thing while an instance is a single object
that has been created in memory. 
Usually an instance will have values assigned to it's properties 
that differentiates it from other instances of the type of object.

src: https://leimao.github.io/blog/Tmux-Tutorial/ (in read mode)

session(windows(panes))
tmux is a termianl manager which can be used in 
ssh commands

ctrl+b for running tmux commands
just press ctrl+b and press the rest of the buttons



two things : terminal and tmux console

to access tmux console: 
        ctrl+b :

create sessions:
        $tmux
        $tmux new
        $tmux new-session
        :new (ctrl+b+:)

detach sessions:
        ctrl+b+d (runs stuff in background)
        $exit (kills)

tmux session with name:
        tmux new-s [session-name]

view active session:
        $tmux ls
        $tmux list-sessions
        ctrl+b+s (esc/q to escape the info)

rename sessions:
        tmux rename-session [-t session-name][new-session-name]
        if [t-session] is not specified then the last active session is renamed
        ctrl+b+&

kill sessions:
        $tmux kill-server (kills all active sessions)
        $tmux kill-server -t[session-name] (kills the specific session)

attach tmux sessions (attaches the local terminak=l to the tmux session):
        $tmux attach -t[session name]


tmux session contains multiple windows:
        to create a window:
                ctrl+b+c 

        to kill a window:
                ctrl+b+$

        to kill a pane:
                ctrl+b+x

        to rename a window:
                ctrl+b+,

        to select a window:
                ctrl+b+(0,1,2,3,4) window id
                ctrl+b+p (previous window)
                ctrl+b+n (next window)

tmux windows contains panes:
        horizontal pane
                ctrl+b+% (divides into half)
                ctrl+b+" (divides vertically)

        close pane:
                ctrl+b+x

        resize pane:
                ctrl+arrow (hold control then resize with arrow keys)

restore session: (tmux resseruct extension)
        save session:
                ctrl+b + ctrl+s

        restore sesssion:
                ctrl+b + ctrl+r

move screen without moving cursor:
ctrl+E (down)
ctrl+Y (up)

Features

    prefix + s prompt for long session lists.
    
    prefix + g - prompts for session name and switches to it. Performs 'kind-of' name completion.
    Faster than the built-in prefix + s

    prefix + C (shift + c) - prompt for creating a new session by name.

    prefix + X (shift + x) - kill current session without detaching tmux.

    prefix + S (shift + s) - switches to the last session.
    The same as built-in prefix + L that everyone seems to override with some other binding.

    prefix + @ - promote current pane into a new session.
    Analogous to how prefix + ! breaks current pane to a new window.

    prefix + t<secondary-key> - join currently marked pane (prefix + m) to current session/window, and switch to it
        secondary-keys
            h, -, ": join horizontally
            v, |, %: join vertically

src python oop basics video
python oops concepts:
encapsulation

@classmethod in python, it refrences the class itself
acceses the class attributes

@staticmethod in python 
print (f"hello world: {variable}")

if we havent assignerd the attribute yet we can pass in
extra attributes, by defining them outside the class block


using the attributes from the init by using the 

assert <attribute>:
checking the values are right type or value;

if the assertion is unfullfiled then 
the assertion error is printed


global attributes which can be accesed by all the objects 
are defined under class
e.g.
class stuff():
        price = 11

displaying/ acesing all the attributes of an object:
        <class_name>.__dict__

acesing all the attributes of an object 
        <object_name>.__dict__

it stores them in the form of a dictionary

csv- common seperated vlaue
used in python by using ; import csv

@classmethod does :
@staticmethod means

static method and class method differences

Big O notation:
1.keep fastest growing term 
2.drop the constants

e.g 
for code:
.........................
for i in range(0,n):
        print(i)
.........................
the time complexity is:
t=a*n+b

finding big O using the rules:
t=a*n+b  
> t=a*n (keep fastest growing term) 
> t=n (removing the constants)
hence, 
complexity = O(n)

for code:
.........................
for i in range(0,n):        
        for j in range(0,i):
                print()
.........................
the time complexity is:
t=a*n2+b

finding big O using the rules:
t=a*n2+b  
> t=a*n2 (keep fastest growing term) 
> t=n2 (removing the constants)
hence, 
complexity = O(n2)

Big O literally means big number of zeroes,
numbers so big that only the number matters 
only fastest growing term is considered
constants are dropped 
cause, nothing else matters.

bin search is a search operation which axts on a sorted list
goes to middle of list, agian and again till it finds the element

big O is considered in worst case scenario

href in html is used for -making links
<link>-linking external stylesheets

<div> defines the division or section in html
        used as a container for html styled by inline css

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.ASP

type tags directly use intellisense suggestions by tab

you can mix and match commands in vim i.e use db, d:delete, b:
ctrl+r for redo in vim 

you can bake all the javascript, css inside html, instead of making seperate files of it
(not suggested), <style> for css, and <script> for JS

javascript adds dynamicness to the page 

thinking of making better commit notes, in order to use them as an Index
better but less commits...?

use tab more often in Terminal
